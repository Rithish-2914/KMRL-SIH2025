- **Key Tables**: users, departments, documents, document_routes, notifications, audit_logs, knowledge_graph

### Environment Variables
Required variables in `.env.local`:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI features
- `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY`: For OCR
- `GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY`: For translation
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: For authentication
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Application URL

## Development

### Running Locally
The development server runs automatically via the "Server" workflow:
- **Port**: 5000
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (required for Replit proxy)
- **Command**: `npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`

### Key Files & Directories
- `/app/*`: Next.js pages and API routes
- `/components/*`: React components (UI and feature components)
- `/lib/*`: Utility libraries (database, AI services, helpers)
- `/public/*`: Static assets and PWA manifest
- `/scripts/*`: Database migration scripts

### Technology Stack
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: Sonner (toast)

## Deployment
Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment:
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start**: `npm run start -- -H 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`
- **Type**: Autoscale (stateless web app)

## User Preferences
- None set yet

## Known Issues
- **Security**: Document files currently use mock public paths - in production, these should be served via authenticated API routes with permission checks to prevent unauthorized access
- **PDF Viewer**: Document detail page has PDF viewer placeholder - production implementation should use PDF.js or react-pdf for embedded viewing
- Minor React ref warnings in Button component (non-blocking)
- TypeScript errors in `lib/ai-services.ts` are suppressed in build config
